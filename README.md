# SneakerHead
# Sneakers shop application using Flutter + Animations
## Description
I made this app as practice in my Flutter 100 days challenge for myself.
in this project, I used animation as the first time I used that.
the UI of this project is not my idea and I found it on the Dribble website but that was simple and I decided to change it and improve that.

I Hope you Like this Project❤!
